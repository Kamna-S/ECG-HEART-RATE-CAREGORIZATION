# ECG-HEART-RATE-CAREGORIZATION
Basically it is a deep learning project which is implemented by using image dataset and the dataset is available on Kaggle. 
This is the link of the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erhmrai/ecg-image-data
For executing this project you just need to download the data set and upload that dataset into your google drive and then mount the drive into your google colab.
This is an end to end project you can try categorizing any kind of ecg images.
I am also including the project report and presentation of this project.
